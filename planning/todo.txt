Overall flow
* last stage - getting different types of users to behave differently
* validators on the values for event and user.





* create a users list component
* create an events list component
** searchable by teacher, student, past, future
* extend the event scope
* keep users from accessing system until approved
* fix the issue with persistent sign-up page
* respond with better errors
* edit user - if you fill in your student id or email you will get the entire record
** all that you can do if you have not been validated.  You can't do anything with events until validated.
* send an email



----
* note - the student list needs to keep the status of the events in the list [ planned, attended, not-attended ]






---------------
* change the database target
* change all messages to events
* extend the user scope
